Mochi saw his first Lunar New Year parade in Belmont, Massachusetts this February. He enjoyed the fantastic lion dance which was performed by the Boston Korean Traditional Dance Group. The drums were a bit loud for him, but he still enjoyed the crowds welcoming the Year of the Rabbit. Check out the [Belmont Public Schools News page][belmont-news] for more information on the Lunar New Year Festival and Parade.
